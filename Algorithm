You should prepare a 1-page (preferably, at most) paper describing your whatever algorithm(s) you use. You
don't have to discuss the display; just how you choose edge placement, graph flow capacities, and how you
compute reasonable flow values. All of this at a high level of abstraction (again, to simplify your life)
