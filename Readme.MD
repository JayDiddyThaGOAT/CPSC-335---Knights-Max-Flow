# Project 3: Knights Max Flow
This project essentially creates a flow graph from a specified source and sink. We attempted to follow the Karp-Edmond algorithm in which we performed a Breadth-First Search in our 10x10 graph to discover an augmented path between the source and the sink. Consequently, we caluclated the edges' capacities and the overall max flow of the graph.

## Setup and Installation: 
Gmail blocked us from sending a JS file. Nevertheless, here is the necessary steps to setup our project.
1. In 335-p1_JVJ folder, open  assets folder
2. Open draw-stuff.txt
3. Go to 'File' -> 'Save as' 
4. Rename file to draw-stuff.js *AND* change 'Save as type' to "All files"
5. Save

## Features
* Creates a 10x10 graph that has a specified location for the source and the sink
* Creates a path from the source to the sink
* Calculates the max flow and the number of unused edges.
