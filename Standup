CPSC-335 Project-1 Knightâ€™s Max Flow Standup Status Report
Standup Status: Start
Team: JVJ = Jalen Jackson, Victoria Tran, Justin Castillo
Jalen:
1.	Completed: Created Grid, lines and algorithm to travel from source to sink
2.	Plan to Complete: make list to keep track of edges
3.	Obstacles: 
Victoria:
1.	Completed: research Ford Fulkerson algorithm, assisted flow algorithm construction
2.	Plan to Complete: Algorithm paper, create Readme
3.	Obstacles: implementing the Ford Fulkerson algorithm
Justin:
1.	Completed: Created knight movement and assisted in algorithm construction
2.	Plan to Complete: Big-O analysis
3.	Obstacles: understanding how many times the system runs its while loops

Progress Board
1.	Create 10x10 board
2.	Understand/figure out what algorithm to use
3.	Write pseudo code
